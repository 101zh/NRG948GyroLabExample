# Example of Displaying Gyro Values in Shuffleboard
##
## About
Rookies can show values in different ways, so allow them to experiment. This was coded for a NavX.
The way that values are displayed is by first creating a tab in shuffleboard, then creating a layout. After that, adding doubles to display those values inside the layout. Then the `initShuffleboard` method is called to initialize shuffleboard tabs and layouts.
